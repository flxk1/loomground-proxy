# loomground-proxy

**Does this measurement still stand for what it claims?**

Declared substitutions checked against two readings. Gamed, unchecked, misleading, tracking. Substitutions chain, and a chain must ground out.

## Scope

One problem. This package answers the question above and nothing adjacent to it.
If a change here would also need a second question answered, it belongs in a
different repository.

## Where it sits

```
grammar ──▶ versum ──▶ solver ──▶ loomground-proxy
```

Above the reasoning kernel, never beside it. It uses `loomground-solver`'s shared
three-valued verdict, its OPEN-dominant strict-AND fold, and its injected ports —
and reaches into no solver internals. Nothing in the kernel imports this package,
and nothing here imports governance, a corpus, or a domain.

## Contract

The package **reports**; it resolves nothing and decides nothing. Judgements
arrive already made, from whoever can be held to them, and are compared rather
than derived. Where a term is absent it escalates rather than passing: an
unmeasured input is not the same as a satisfied one, and the two never collapse
into a single value.

## Install

```
pip install loomground-proxy
```
